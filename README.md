# clu-card

A library to deduce as much knowledge of a Cluedo\* or Clue\* game as possible using only the knowledge that a player can 
gain by observing the actions of each turn during game play.

## Usage
    
The main function in this library is the `add-turn` function which takes two maps, one representing a guess the other
representing a game, and returns a new game with any new deducible information in `:have` or `:lack` which are each a
map with players' names as keys and a map of what knowledge we know about their hand. `:have` contains knowledge about 
what cards and their types each player has in their hand, `:lack` about the cards known not to be in their hand.

    (add-turn (guess "player A" "Mustard" "rope" "dining room" "player C") game-map)
    
`(guess player suspect weapon location disproved-by)` produces a map representing a guess
    
    (guess "player A" "Mustard" "rope" "dining room" "player C") =>
      {:player       "player A"
       :suspect      "Mustard"
       :weapon       "rope"
       :location     "dining room"
       :disproved-by "player C"}
